1. Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following 	
methods and print the final salary.
	1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work 	
per day of employee as parameter
	2  - 'AddSal()' which adds Rs.1000 to salary of the employee if 		
it is less than Rs8000.
	3 - 'AddWork()' which adds Rs500 to salary of employee if the 	
number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.

2. We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three 
 subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out 
 of 100) by student B. 
Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract 
 method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' 
 each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of 
 the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three 
 subjects as its parameters .
the constructor of student B takes the marks in four subjects as its 
 parameters  . Create an object for each of the two classes 
 and print the percentage of marks for both the students.
