Exercise on git


Create folder mygit                                          
change ur current working folder to mygit                                           
initialize git                                           
create a file test.txt                                             
add the line - hello how do you do                                                 
check the status of git
add it to staging and commit it with message "exercise1"
create a branch LB
inside the branch LB modify the test.txt
                                 add the following text
                                             
save and commit  with message "exercise2"
go back to master branch
see the difference between master and LB
create a branch from master as CC       
create a new file 'mystory.txt'
write 'this is the title of the story'
add and commit the same in CC branch
list all the branches
                              
see the diff between master and Cc
goto CC     
modify the CC by saying -  'this is about harry potter'
stage the file mystory.txt
after staging you feel that this is not about Harry Potter but about batsman
unstage the file back to working directory
                                           
modify the mystory.txt to
'this is about batsman'
stage and commit
                                      
modify the mystory.txt to 
' detailing about batsman- he will fly  using his magic wings'
Now you feel that your story is not correct. Go back to the last committed version
                                
see the git status
                                   
see the file in cat  command
                               
goto LB
                            
goto master
                               
comeback to CC
